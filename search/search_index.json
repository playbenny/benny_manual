On mid range hardware 256 samples is a good target, 64 is a sensible minimum for high end systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upsampling is a common simple way to mitigate aliasing in harmonics generated by digital processing. Most of benny's non-linear audio blocks default to upsampling x2 as it makes a noticeable difference to the clarity of the sound. However upsampling obviously increases the CPU usage. You can adjust it (from 1x-128x) in the sidebar settings section for the block, or the <code>\"UPSAMPLING\"</code> setting can be unticked to disable upsampling for all blocks on a particular computer (for example if your main computer is lost or broken and you borrow a less powerful one to run your set).</p> </li> <li> <p>Max Scheduler max has some options for how the underlying engine balances the various kinds of tasks it has to perform.

When you start benny it preloads all the songfiles, then looks to see if it can preload any samples too. When you choose the next song it recycles as many blocks as it can, so that load times are as quick as possible. </p> <p>If you want to play one song and then the next (stopping in between like a band), then benny will easily load the next song before people stop clapping.</p> <p>If you want to segue seamlessly between songs there are a few approaches:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Merge lets you load the next song in with the current one. All of the new song's blocks appear on the blocks page to the right of the blocks for the song that is currently playing. </p> <p>benny only permits one copy of certain blocks - for example hardware blocks and core.control.input.auto. These blocks are therefore shared between the current and next song, but benny will automatically move them over to their position in the new song.</p> <p>benny also cleans up as you merge: any muted blocks in the old song (and all connected blocks that aren't in use elsewhere) will be deleted as the new song merges in. To disable this behaviour in ui preferences uncheck <code>\"PURGE_MUTED_TREES\"</code>.</p> <p>After merge you will see two new buttons in the top bar: select previous and select new, which can be used to delete bits of old song.</p> </li> <li> <p>Output blocks </p> <p>In the hardware setup, every audio output on your computer has the option to run another layer of audio processing, called 'output blocks'. By default benny applies a transparent anti-aliasing clipper and dither here. Because these are part of the hardware setup rather than part of the song they are always present, even when benny is loading a new song.</p> <p>There are two (prototype) output blocks included:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The stretch_looper lets you grab a loop of the playing track and keep it looping while the next one loads. It uses z-plane timestretch to make it match the tempo of the next song. This is still a work in progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>The big reverb does what you expect it to.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hardware loopers, delays or reverbs - anything that can be used to fill 2-10 seconds works here! In my current live setup I've built an external version of the stretch looper that runs in a Bela Pepper Eurorack module and additionally provides an emergency loop in the unlikely event of my computer crashing.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Live set pro-tip: To prevent crashes, tape your usb cables into the ports, at both ends, every time.</p>"},{"location":"mixer/","title":"Mixer","text":"<p>You don't need to structure your patches around a mixer - it's fine to route everything into the main audio outputs if you want - but benny does contain some mixer blocks.</p> <p>The benny mix blocks use airwindows console 7 for non-linear summing. For this to work, you have to go from the mix.channel / mix.stereo.channel blocks into a mix.bus block, and there can't be anything else inbetween the two and this connection has to be at unity gain. benny takes care of this last constraint. You can add more voices to either kind of channel block to add more channels. The three modes (channel, cascade, crunch) give the channels progressively more aggressive saturation characteristics. In the mix bus block you can toggle all airwindows non-linear summing for the whole set.</p> <p>You can assign a midi controller directly to the mixer in the mix.bus block. The controller code uses smart-soft-pickup to avoid ever having discontinuities or dead fader zones.</p> <p></p> <p>You can also view the mix.bus ui in a special 'bottom bar' area, a button to toggle this will appear bottom left. </p> <p>You can name individual channels by ctrl-clicking the name area.</p> <p>If you select multiple connections all going to the same destination benny can insert a mixer into them all for you.
