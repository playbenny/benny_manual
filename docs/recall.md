The recall page of benny lets you trigger states and choose which patterns sequencer blocks are playing.

On the left states (if there are any) are shown. You can trigger the whole state from the left hand column or just trigger it for an individual block.

On the right all sequencer blocks that support patterns are shown, along with all the saved patterns. 

Click a pattern to select it (and start playing from it).

Ctrl-click selects a pattern and resyncs it.

Ctrl-click on the block names at the bottom toggles mute. Clicking a pattern unmutes the block it's on.

If you hold shift while clicking patterns and states and ctrl-clicking block names then benny will wait until both shift is released and the first beat of a bar happens.
