**alt-click** - to bypass blocks

**drag** - to connect blocks

**scroll** - to zoom

**ctrl-scroll** - over a wire, adjust connection level

**ctrl-alt-V** - paste blocks including their connections. For example, if you copy an oscillator that is connected to a mixer and a midi source, then the pasted duplicate will have the same connections.

**ctrl-d** - duplicate selected blocks

**ctrl-z** - undo

**del** / **backspace** - delete everything selected

**shift-del** / **shift-backspace** - 'delete tree' - deletes the selected blocks, then any blocks that were only connected to/from a deleted block, recursively.

**shift-T** - 'select tree' - selects what delete tree would delete. useful for saving a part of a patch out as a template. by default select tree, delete tree and mute tree all ignore connections to core.input.control.* blocks when counting connections but the config key ```TREE_SELECT_IGNORES_CONTROL_BLOCKS``` can change this.

**alt-left arrow** - back to previous sidebar view

**alt click** - to return a slider to its default value (or to the value saved in your songfile).





##PERSONALISING

The shortcuts are all stored in keymap.json. If you press a key combination that isn't assigned then benny prints 'keycode 994' or similar to the max console. This number is what you need to swap into the relevent entry in this file if you want to change a keyboard mapping.
