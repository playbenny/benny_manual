### Donate
- If you find benny useful and you can afford it, the tip jar is [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBQ7JWRPJKLWQ).
### Report bugs
- Create a new bug report [here](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/issues).
- A good bug report contains a clear description of the problem and steps or attached files to reliably reproduce it.
- In many cases, benny prints useful information to the max console. This may not be visible on your computer, but should come up if you press **ctrl-shift-m** while on the benny launcher window.
- If you're not sure, start by opening a [discussion](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions) instead.
### Fix bugs
- Create a new branch of the repository.
- Fix the bug in your branch.
- Submit a pull request to have your fix merged back into the main repository.
- Any questions or doubts, start a [discussion](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions).
### Contribute blocks
- It's very easy to make blocks. If you make something good and want it to be part of the public repository you are welcome to submit it. You can name your blocks with your own prefix, and that prefix will be given its own section of the blocks menu.
- Create a new branch, commit your block files to it, submit a pull request.
### Contribute VST plugin setup files
- benny comes with a library of VST plugin config files so it will work out the box with these. If you make a config file for a VST plugin that is not yet included, please submit it to the library via the [forum](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions) or pull request.
### Contribute controller setup files
- If your midi controller isn't automatically set up by benny then once you've finished configuring it please do share that configuration so it can become part of the distribution. You can just upload your whole hardware config file to the [forum](https://github.com/playbenny/benny/discussions) and I can cut out the relevant section.
### Help with this manual or make video demos
- This manual is a [separate github repository](https://github.com/playbenny/bennyDocs). If you hit a problem or question that isn't answered here please do add your solution to the appropriate section of the manual.
