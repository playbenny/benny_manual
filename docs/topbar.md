the top bar is almost always visible and contains (from left to right):

- **cpu meter** - shows range of cpu usage in the last few frames. click it to bring up the resource utilisation page in the sidebar.

- **play button** - starts and stops the global transport. black = stopped, yellow = playing. when loading songs the surround of this button is grey until everything has loaded. you're still free to press play before loading completes.

- **hardware input meters** - in order, every hardware audio input you have set up. clicking the meter shows a scope. clicking the title in that scope selects the block that output is a part of, if it is present in the patch.

- **hardware output meters** - meters for all your outputs to hardware. as with all meters in benny these show min/max values in the last frame.

- **resync button** - when you press this, on the next '1' of the global clock, all sequencers (and other blocks that support this) will reset their playhead counters and attempt to resynchronise

- **all off** - pressing this tells every block to stop all playing notes, or equivalent. the keyboard shortcut for this is `, the key to the left of the numbers row.

- **panels** - switches to the [panels](panels.md) page. ctrl click switches to the panels page layout editor

- **blocks** - switches to the [blocks](blocks.md) page. ctrl click switches to the flock view, if any blocks have flocking enabled.

- **waves** - switches to the [waves](waves.md) page.

- **files** - opens the [load / save sidebar](files.md). holding ctrl makes this button into a load / save button that pops open a file selection dialog directly.
