# Blockipedia

Every block has a help/description text you can view in the sidebar. This automatically generated page collates them all.

## core

### core.clock
- Control tempo, swing, and microtiming settings for multiple free but synchronised clock sources. 1 voice = 1 clock. The clocks are synchronised using a discrete time kuramoto algorithm which mirrors many naturally occuring synchronisation and alignment processes. 

- When you merge-load in another song that contains a clock, it won't adjust the global tempo until you unmute the new clock. 

- Headphone click offset is measured in multiples of vector size, so it should stay consistent if you change vs in future. 

- There's a hidden parameter that's available for midi mapping called **tempo bend**, if you map eg a pitchbend controller to this you can do dj-style tempo bends.

- If you want to synchronise external gear via midi clock out or a gate clock over audio you can configure these in the hardware manager.

- To enable ableton link support, you need to install the ableton link package for max. To do this, open a new max window, go file / package manager and search for ableton link. Install the package and restart benny. Then click on the midi indicators right of the play button. In the sidebar page that appears there's an option to enable link.

### core.input.control.auto
- Midi controller input with optional automapping.

- The values from your midi controller's knobs and sliders are output by this block so you can use them to modulate parameters etc. 

- You can save a starting position for all, or in 'edit mode' you can save those individually. Edit mode also lets you assign colours to knobs (for controllers like the midi fighter twister / launch control xl 3 that have rgb leds) and also for controllers that have encoders or motorised pots you can set up 'end zone forces' - areas at either end of the range that either repel or attract the fader position. This is useful eg for delay feedback controls - you can set it to turn itself down if you forget to (!).

- For standard potentiometers benny has a (unique?) smart soft pickup system, where fader curves are recalibrated around the current position and the actual value, so as well as avoiding jumps there are no dead zones (like normal soft pickup faders) - increasing the knob always increases the value & the converse.

- If auto assign is turned on then when a block is selected the controller will auto assign to this block's parameters. When you deselect the block the midi controller goes back to it's normal mode - outputting values from this block. 

- You can only have one of these core.input.control.auto blocks per song, for other midi controllers use the core.input.control.basic block.

### core.input.control.basic
- Midi controller input.

- The values from your midi controller's knobs and sliders are output by this block so you can use them to modulate parameters etc. 

- This kind of input block does not use auto assign, just outputs the controls to wherever you route them.  

### core.input.keyboard
- Midi keyboard input. Outputs notes played and the usual keyboard controllers. 

- If auto assign is turned on then when a block is selected the keyboard notes are sent to that block instead, until the block is deselected.

- The block records the last 64 bars of what you've played, and by switching to loop (or overdub) modes - default shortcut F9 - you can select a section of that history. once you're happy with your selection range pressing the spawn button (default shortcut ctrl-F9) will spawn 1 or more seq.piano.roll objects (depending on what you have connected)

### core.scales.shapes
- Scales and shapes storage and editting. 

- Benny has 8 scale slots, you can access these by adding more voices to this block. (1 voice = 1 scale). You can use these for quantisation - eg in midi.scale.quantise or fx.retune etc - but this block can also store patterns in the form of the scale and a list ('shape') of which notes occurred in which order. The seq.shape.player can play back and mutate these patterns.

- You can enter scales with the mouse by clicking the keyboard graphics. 

- You can make scales (dynamically if you want!) using midi (or QWERTY!) input in two ways: 

- For midi into the 'held' input the currently held notes are stored along with the order they were added. 

- A phrase played into the 'pattern' input is turned into a list of notes and the order they were received. it decides you've finished a couple of hundred ms after the last note off, so you can input repeated notes by either holding another previous note while you enter them, or by leaving a very short gap between them, but you do have to wait a tiny moment if you want to enter a new scale so that it doesn't treat it all as one. 

- Scales can also span two octaves, if the scale you input is bigger than an octave then it treats it as being two. In the mouse interface if you hold shift it only adds/removes in the current octave. 

### core.space
- Lets you blow a wind-like force into the flocked parameters simulation. Also has controls for visual declarification.

### core.states
- recall states via midi message. note number = state number. blend input does a xfade from current state to the selected one, based on the velocity of the incoming note.

### core.tuning
- global tuning controller. 

- affects all of benny's source and voice blocks, and can be applied to any vst or amxd (max for live device) instrument that supports pitchbend. 

- you can tune each note pitch individually, enabling various tunings of 12 tones or less. internally benny's tuning system would support everything a scala file contains, but scala import isn't yet implemented. 

- the tilt and nonlin controls simulate inaccurate tuning in analogue synths and eg pianos - with tilt stretching the tuning across the whole range, which is common in pianos badly tuned by ear, and nonlin introducing slight brownian deviations as you'd see from slightly nonlinear midi-cv conversion in an analogue synth. this is calculated per-voice, so increasing it increases tuning spread of polysynths. these detunings are in addition to any detuning controls in benny blocks. offset lets you tune to the nearest churchbells or the hum of the mains in your town or 432Hz if you believe in that sort of thing.

- if you create presets for more scales please do submit them (eg by github discussion forum post)

## seq

### seq.eight.step.rhythm
- Parametric rhythm pattern generator by Luke Abbott

### seq.jumps
- takes the incoming note, if it's above C3 it steps up the scale, if it's below C3 it steps down. the further from C3, the bigger the step. notes in the reset input reset the position in the scale to the one nearest the reset note. 

### seq.note.step
- note step sequencer. add more voices for more polyphony. the editor shows you patterns on other voices as hollow notes. 

- You can either record live or step record into this block, turn on the record button in the sidebar. 

- The start point can be before, inside or even after the loop points. the loop follow mode determines how it behaves if you move the loop position or length sliders while it's playing - in soft mode if you move the loop later it will just gradually play through into the new loop, in hard mode it will jump into the new loop. 

- You can also choose how it behaves when a new pattern is selected. the default is to keep the playhead where it was and just carry on reading from the new pattern, but you can also have it reset the playhead to the start point in the new pattern, and optionally to quantise that. to make this step sequencer act like a clip in ableton live use the quantise to bar setting.

### seq.note.tracker
- note tracker. each voice is a monophonic channel of midi notes, add more voices for more polyphony. 

- You can either record live or step record into this block, turn on the record button in the sidebar. 

- notes with no length are only cut off by the next note or entering an 'off' with the 1 key. 

- editor keys:
- notes start at z for the bottom octave and q for the top octave and a half
- 1 enters an 'off' in the notes column
- L and , switch octave
- .or backspace clears a cell (or row if you're in the note column)
- del deletes a row, insert inserts one
- hold shift and use arrows or click to select an area
- ctl-c,ctl-x,ctl-v,ctl-a, ctl-l copy cut paste select all select a whole column
- ctl-i interpolates values from one end of a selection to the other.
- '#' toggles 'grouping' for a row. grouped rows (indicated by a small indent) work as a single step, every time the playhead lands on this step it plays the next one of the grouped notes, round-robin-ing. so if you have a sequence CCCDEF and the last 4 are grouped it'll play CCCCCCCDCCCECCCF. 

- The start point can be before, inside or even after the loop points. the loop follow mode determines how it behaves if you move the loop position or length sliders while it's playing - in soft mode if you move the loop later it will just gradually play through into the new loop, in hard mode it will jump into the new loop. 

- You can also choose how it behaves when a new pattern is selected. the default is to keep the playhead where it was and just carry on reading from the new pattern, but you can also have it reset the playhead to the start point in the new pattern, and optionally to quantise that. to make this step sequencer act like a clip in ableton live use the quantise to bar setting.

### seq.piano.roll
- Classic piano roll sequencer. 
- Unlike many other benny sequencers this one has an internal clock linked to the global clock and doesn't need a clock in. (It does follow timing drift from the kuramoto section of the clock if that's enabled.)

- ctrl-click to create events, ctrl drag to create many events (in a values lane). scroll adjusts velocity or cc levels, drag or arrow keys to move events, ctrl+scroll, drag or arrow keys to adjust lengths. 

- scroll or shift+scroll on the time ruler for zoom/pan. or drag on the ruler, or drag on the background. 

- shift+drag for a selection rectangle, alt+drag copies selected events.

- press 3 to put the ruler into triplet divisions of beats when zoomed in.

- press q to time quantise the selected notes or events to the current grid.

- l makes the selected notes legato.

- drag the loop handles or scroll over the loop start / length etc numbers.

### seq.rene
- a circle on a cartesian plane step sequencer, obviously inspired by the module of the same name

### seq.shape.player
- The core.scales.shapes block stores the 'shape' of a pattern played into it as well as the scale. This block plays back these shapes. 

- You can transpose them in-scale, rotate in time or apply several other types of ornamentation and variation using this block. You can also play a shape using a different scale to the one it was entered in.

- The ornaments sliders control how often the various types of ornamentation occur. 

- On the second midi input C = reset, notes from C# upwards trigger one of the ornament types directly.

### seq.values
- a simple step sequencer for one dimensional values. the 'notes out' uses the value as a note, and the velocity from the incoming trigger. the 'values out' sends it as a value, which you can rotate to map to any combination of velocity or pitch if you want to send it to a midi destination.

- add voices to the block to add more sequencer rows.

- on this sequencer the record mode is step recording which disables the trigger input until you turn it off, and stores either incoming notes or incoming velocities, depending on the toggle switch setting.

### seq.wonky
- The step time sliders control the length of each step, the block pro-ratas these lengths to make them fit into the time period you've set below. You can use this as a clock or there are also value sliders so you can use it as a stand alone sequencer - it outputs both the raw slider values and quantised pitches (with vel following incoming clocks).

### seq.analogue
- A simple 'analogue-style' step sequencer. Each step has note, vel, and on/off. 

- Adding more voices adds more playheads traversing the same sequence. 

- You can clock this sequencer from midi or from audio pulses, or you can use an audio signal to set the playhead position, enabling audio-rate scanning of the sequence.

### seq.curved.time
- This sequencer is about bending time. It sums the internal phasors and the audio input into a timing signal. When this crosses the thresholds (set as even divisions of the 0-1 range) a trigger is emitted. Using interesting timing signals will create interesting rhythms. You can use the division number or counter outputs to address positions of other sequencers (eg seq.values, note.step, note.tracker..) or use the trigger events as a clock to drive other sequencers (eg shape.player, seq.rene)

### seq.sample.tracker
- UNFINISHED

- buzz-style sample tracker.

- works but none of the fx commands are implemented yet.

- i don't think the max/msp sample playback objects do anti-aliasing so if you're pitching samples up turn on oversampling for this block.

## midi

### midi.calculus
- Differentials and integrals of midi value streams.

- This block can output a value representing the speed and direction of movement of a value, or output a value only when it changes, or sum a value over time.

### midi.chord.hold
- Implements the korg mono/poly's *autodamp* feature. 

- Note offs are stored up and not sent, even when all notes are released. Only when a new note starts after a silence are they all sent. Works nicely for paraphonic pads if you play the voices through this and have a separate envelope for a main vca like a mono/poly.

### midi.curve.map.1d
- Maps input values to output values defined by the curve you draw with the sliders. Useful for control mappings. You can choose how many sliders there are if you want a few neat steps.

### midi.delay
- Delays midi events, with optional filtering so that if you patch feedback into this block it won't go on forever.

- The per-note random delays are useful for eg randomly varying the order and spacing of the notes of chords.

### midi.ducker
- Sidechain midi ducker by Luke Abbott

### midi.ext.clock
- Receives midi clock from the input you've set up in hardware manager, and divides it to whatever rate you'd like. If your incoming clock is 24ppqn the fastest division is 32nd note triplet. 

- Can optionally also attempt to synchronise the global transport.

### midi.fidget
- ADHD for a controller. refuses to sit on one value for too long, once it gets bored takes a brownian hop to a nearby value. for example, put it between a midi controller and the parameter you want to control.

### midi.fold.transpose
- Transposes, folding notes that lie outside the set range. 

- The last control, 'glissando', determines whether the output notes change when you adjust the controls as opposed to just when new notes come in. You can send midi to the second input to set the transpose value.

### midi.free.clock
- a free-running clock, disconnected from the global one

### midi.holes
- Forgets some midi events, randomly

### midi.lfo
- A midi LFO, if you add more voices they're linked, so you can build eg quadrature lfos from this.

### midi.note.length
- sets the length of midi notes. 

- when set to zero the notes are passed as instantaneous triggers with no length. 

- randomness increases the length of notes, the randomness shape control alters the distribution of random values from evenly spread (at 0) to more like a steep curve skewed towards zero (at 1).

### midi.note.select
- filters notes based on whether they are in the selected scale. 

- also splits to one output per note

### midi.pitch.range
- gate (or split) notes based on pitch

### midi.rhythmes.alpes
- Fades / switches between subdivisions of a clock, inspired by the mechanical proto-drummachine used by the wonderful french group 'Catherine Ribiero & Alpes'.

- The controls let you choose which divisions are emphasised and whether it's just a single division or a combination of several.

### midi.scale.quantise
- Quantises notes to scales. 

- In quantise mode the first note in the scale below the incoming one is picked, in index mode the note number of the input is used as the index in the list of notes in the scale. For example if the scale was CEG and you played C0,C#0,F0 into it in quantise mode you'd get C0,C0,E0, in index mode you'd get C0,E0,G1. 

- Scales are saved and can be dynamically set by incoming midi in the core.scales.shapes block, so this will be loaded automatically. 

- This block works efficiently for fast note streams (including if you patch an audio signal to the note in) but there is also a utility.audio.scale.quantise which works all the way up to audio rate.

### midi.smooth
- Uses a 2 pole low pass filter modulated by a bandpass out of the same filter to smooth values in a way which responds well to fast changes. Algorithm by Andrew Simper of Cytomic from here: https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/DynamicSmoothing.pdf. The 'sensitivity' control governs how much the bandpass modulates the lowpass.

### midi.stats
- Useful metrics about the incoming midi:
- -notecount
- -lowest
- -highest
- -quietest
- -loudest
- -time interval between notes

### midi.sustain
- hold the last n notes. if n=0 it turns all notes into instantaneous triggers with no duration.

### midi.switch
- Has multiple ins and outs, lets you select an input and route it to an output, (accomplishing the functions of the max gate and switch objects). Also lets you select i/o via midi and cycle through io via midi

### midi.tilt+.scan
- Generates modulation for multiple voices: wire each voice of this block to a voice on a block you want to modulate, in order, and this will let you tilt (optionally exponentially) the values and/or 'scan' a resizeable bump through the voices' values. 

- you can also use this block attached to eg a harmonic oscillators partials sliders to replicate the 'verbos harmonic oscillator' eurorack module, or to the fixed filter bank block.

### midi.utility.buttons
- 3 buttons on a panel, 3 separate outputs. 

-  Optionally the vertical position of the button click can affect the output velocity. 

- While the button is lit (hold/toggle modes) the 'switched inputs' pass midi messages to their respective outputs.

### midi.utility.delay
- utility delay for midi. has time settings in samples, vectors, ms and beats that are added together.

### midi.utility.values
- 3 sliders 3 values, useful for offsetting params of individual voices, summing modulations, flocking variables from different blocks, etc

### midi.velocity
- gate notes based on velocity
- compress or expand velocity range
- humanise velocity
- control output velocity range

### midi.wait
- Collects up notes that come in until a trigger is received in the second input, at which point it dumps them all out in the order they were received. The clear input wipes the stored notes.

## source

### source.abl.chip
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.chip oscillator. only available in max 9.

### source.abl.crackle
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.crackle oscillator. only available in max 9.

### source.auto.drummer
- Pattern based drum machine, with DR110 samples.  Intentionally simple, intended as a quick source of drums as a writing aid.  Possibly the greatest drum machine you'll ever encounter.  Made by Luke Abbott.

### source.basic.osc
- single oscillator. the shape control fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges. the 'initial pitch' slider sets the starting pitch, incoming midi overrides this but doesn't reset the slider. 

- the rectangle portion of this oscillator uses EPTR code from Yofiel.com. the saw/tri part is made by integrating this. for notes above C7 turn on oversampling in the block settings for a clearer tone.

### source.braids
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Braids module. 48 different oscillator models! 

- I've adapted it to work with benny's global tuning system. I've also added velocity mod controls, if the vel->vca != 0 it introduces a tiny 3ms delay on notes and triggers to avoid clicks. The scale quantise in the module isn't implemented as it wouldn't work with benny's global tuning, and we have scale quantisers already in benny.

### source.chaos.osc
- chaos oscillator. several different models to pick from. 

- the 'initial state' settings strongly affect the behaviour of some models. if a model blows up try initial values closer to 0 and try rate either near 1 or near 0, they all behave slightly differently. a midi reset sets the model back to the inital state. behaviour also scales with oversampling, and if you want to use this block to generate musical pitches you'll need to set oversampling to 16x or more on the block settings page.

- the algorithms here came from an open source m4l device a friend sent me a long time ago and i've lost the attribution, let me know if you recognise it.

### source.dual.osc
- A pair of basic oscillators with diverse cross modulation possibilities. 

- Shape fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. Accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges. 

- The rectangle portion of this oscillator uses code from Yofiel.com. 

### source.harmonic.osc
- 8 drawbar harmonics, uses non-linear summing borrowed from airwindows console which serves to give it a nice glued character that sits in a mix well, less a collection of digital sines than a single voice.

### source.quanti.slide.osc
- Quanti-slide oscillator. Quantises pitch to the selected scale - the quantiser is after the midi note in (with portamento), the detune, the range, the fm input and the unstable pitch are summed. The slide width control controls the size of a linear transition region between pitches - on 0 you get sharply quantised notes, on 1 you get no quantisation at all. 

- Like the basic osc, shape fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. Accepts MIDI and CV, works in *LFO* and *audio* ranges. The 'initial pitch' slider sets the starting pitch, incoming midi overrides this but doesn't reset the slider. 

- The rectangle portion of this oscillator uses 'EPTR' code from Yofiel.com. 

### source.random.noise.s&h
- inspired by the buchla stepped and continuous random.
- - multiple colours of noise
- - blending shift register
- - sample & hold
- - slew
- - quantise
- - audio input can be used with the s&h / shift register
- - the midi 'both' input feeds the note value into the s&h's audio input (if noise colour slider is on audio input) and also triggers a step, so you can use it to do sublooping type shift register effects on midi patterns.

### source.sacred.waves.osc
- Dual osciallator using Prophet 600 or MonoPoly synth waveforms (switchable) from Sacred Walls.  With crossmod and sub osc.  Made by Luke Abbott.

### source.sheep
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Tides module running the unofficial 'Sheep' firmware, which is a XY wavetable synth oscillator.

### source.shepherd.osc
- Shepherd oscillator. Mixes multiple octaves of a wave to let you make scales that ascend or descend forever, or parts that fluidly morph between high and low frequencies, using the ideas of Roger Shepherd and his famous barberpole tone (which this block can recreate by connecting a rising sawtooth lfo to the fm input). Shape fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. Accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges. The rectangle portion of this oscillator uses code from Yofiel.com. 

### source.stick.slip
- Simple model of an object connected to the user input 'position' by a spring, sticking and slipping chaotically. The texture parameter adds variation to the friction forces as a function of position. This block pairs well with resonators (eg voice.modal, elements). Inspired by Knut Kaulke's work (see https://medias.ircam.fr/x7aa847). The pitch midi input alters the model parameters in order to make the resonant frequency of the mass spring system the note you requested.

### source.tides
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Tides module. The frequency slider is overridden by note inputs.

### source.wave.scan
- A looping wave player that lets you fluidly move around the longer sample while staying quantised. EG if you have a long wav of a drum performance loaded you can 'play' it by moving the target parameter and this block will keep it in time.

## voice

### voice.basic
- a single oscillator with an ASR envelope on its amplitude. the shape control fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges and over fairly long timescales. 

- the envelope can loop, including decay bouncing ball type loops, and features 'accumulation' - when retriggered before the envelope has decayed to silence the remaining level is added to the new target level, so fast sections can be set to build up by themselves, or down. 

- if you're playing near the top of the keyboard range (above C7) turn on oversampling in settings for a clearer tone, particularly on the saw.  

- the rectangle portion of this oscillator uses EPTR code from yofiel.com, the saw/tri is made by integrating this. sine was invented by 2nd century BC egyptian people.

### voice.dual
- A pair of basic oscillators, with 2 envelopes and vcas and a load of diverse cross modulation possibilities. Shape fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. Accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges. The rectangle portion of this oscillator uses code from Yofiel.com. 

### voice.elements
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Elements module.

### voice.harmonic
- 8 drawbar harmonics + env + vca. uses non-linear summing borrowed from airwindows console, and a very gentle sine shaper on the output post env/vca, which all serves to give it a nice glued character that sits in a mix well, less a collection of digital sines than a single voice.

### voice.ks
- Basic KS string model with selfmodulation and a -x^3 saturator in the feedback loop. 

- positive values of 'highpass' are a onepole in the loop, negative values are a 2 pole highpass post-filter. in both cases pitch is relative to the string's current note pitch. 

- selfmod is self-fm simulating a tanpura's curved bridge. negative values have a half-wave rectifier on this modulation.

### voice.ks6
- KS instrument with 6 strings in one voice. You can send pitches to them all individually, or each voice has a built in round-robin allocator around its first 4 strings. The strings all feed energy between themselves, giving the instrument a slightly more nuanced nature than the standard voice.KS, though it uses a little more cpu and lacks the opportunities for per-voice modulation. 

- Unusually for benny, because the each voice of this contains more voices of its own, to make the 'notes' input work with polyphony you'll need to connect your source of notes to the voice not the block.

### voice.modal
- Simple voice made around a bank of resonators and a selection of model algorithms for setting the frequencies, amplitudes and bandwidths of those resonators. Works as a voice you can play with midi input but also as an effect, and can be used to model body resonances for physical modelling patches.

- Models come from an article by Nathan Ho apart from the two measured violin body resonances which come from a paper by Holm & Välimäki and some measurements taken from a bell in a post online, links in the patcher.

- -Elements string

- -Piano stiff string

- -Free Beam (eg xylophone)

- -Cantilever Beam (eg mbira)

- -Rectangular Membrane

- -Rectangular clamped plate

- -Tubular bell

- -Free Plate

- -Good violin

- -Bad violin

- -Measured bell

### voice.multi.sample.player
- multisample player with slices, offset, timestretch, and a set of loose emulations of melotron mechanics - pitch wobble, motor drag (proportional to the number of notes held down), and a finite limit set on rewind speed. 

- this voice expects you to load a wave with an ascending scale, evenly spaced, with the slices set.

- motor drag only works when an actual connection has been made - it won't work when auto-assign keyboard is played into the block. 

- i don't think the max/msp sample playback objects do anti-aliasing so if you're pitching samples up turn on oversampling for this block.

### voice.noise
- noise source that can fade between different colours and types of noise, with a looping, accumulating ASR envelope controlling amplitude. midi in to the 'damp' input causes the envelope to close quickly.

### voice.organ
- 9 drawbar harmonics with a rough model of how the key contacts of a hammond tonewheel organ worked. the notes input blends between pressed and struck profiles based on velocity, with very quiet notes corresponding to partial keypresses that don't engage the switch for every harmonic. inspired by the paper 'Dynamic temporal behaviour of the keyboard action on the Hammond organ and its perceptual significance' by Giulio Moro, Andrew P. McPherson and Mark B. Sandler in JASA 142/5 2017.

### voice.pitch.env
- a single oscillator with pitch envelope and amplitude envelope. ideal as a building block for simple electronic drum sounds, but useful for all sorts of things. also works at lfo rates and over long timescales. 

- both envelopes feature 'accumulation' - when retriggered before the envelope has decayed to silence the remaining level is added to the new target level, so rolls can be set to build up by themselves (or down - when set negative it makes the envelope obey jaki leibzeit's rule of '2nd hit quieter'). the envelopes also have a loop control, when set <1 each repeat of the loop is a little lower, leading to a classic bouncing ball effect. 

### voice.plaits
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Plaits module.

- 16 different engines in one. The input destination controllers work with the original module's different behaviour when patched/unpatched - the parameters that aren't selected here are connected to an internal decay envelope.

### voice.rings
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Rings module.

### voice.sample.player
- sample player with slices, offset, timestretch. 

- i don't think the max/msp sample playback objects do anti-aliasing so if you're pitching samples up turn on oversampling for this block.

### voice.shepherd
- Shepherd oscillator with env and vca. Mixes multiple octaves of a wave to let you make scales that ascend or descend forever, or parts that fluidly morph between high and low frequencies, using the ideas of Roger Shepherd and his famous barberpole tone (which this block can recreate by connecting a rising sawtooth lfo to the fm input). Shape fades from sine through triangle saw rectangle square triangle and back to sine. Accepts MIDI and CV, works in LFO and audio ranges. The rectangle portion of this oscillator uses code from Yofiel.com. 

### voice.wave.guide
- simple wave guide model with 2 filters in the feedback path. 

- the sustained noise exciter type is useful for flutey tones. with a modulation source like per-key aftertouch mapped to the filter frequencies this model does nice performable overblown wind harmonics.

## fx

### fx.abl.distortion
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.distortion. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.abl.fuzz
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.fuzz. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.abl.pitchshift
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.pitchshift. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.abl.waveshaper
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.waveshaper. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.clouds
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Clouds module. The module's internal buffer is 4 seconds long, you can save it to a wave slot and you're also able to load waves into it.

### fx.clouds.pvoc
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of just the phase vocoder from Émilie Gillet's Clouds module.

### fx.convolve
- Simple wrapper for the HISStools max convolution object, uses benny's wave storage for the impulses. You can convolve all sorts of things together, not just reverbs.

- IMPORTANT - to make this work you need to open max package manager (from the file menu) and find and install HISStools.

### fx.delay.buckets
- Bucket Brigade Delay emulation. Accurate model of writing into a delay line with variable sample rate, responds to input changes in the same way a real BBD does. Additionally includes pre-filter, compander, soft sat, boundary loss and clock leakage, post-filter, HPF in one of two positions, and bit depth quantise (to simulate an early digi-delay rather than a BBD).

### fx.delay.stretch
- Delay line with phase vocoder read head allowing time change without pitch shift, or pitch shifted delays.

### fx.delay.tape
- Basic delay line with tape-like repitching, mod, timeslips and saturation. The repitch midi input alters the delay time multiplier to shift by the desired interval (so if for example a C is held in the delayline and you play an F the rate is changed in order to repitch the playback and subsequent repeats up to an F)

### fx.elements.verb
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of just the reverb from Émilie Gillet's Elements module.

### fx.filter.2pole.env
- surreal machines' zero delay feedback filter model with an ASR env built in. there is additionally audio rate cutoff modulation and accurate key follow from the midi input. the outputs are a fade between lowpass and highpass and a separate bandpass.

### fx.filter.2pole
- surreal machines' zero delay feedback filter model. in benny this has audio rate cutoff modulation and accurate key follow from midi input. the outputs are a fade between lowpass and highpass and a separate bandpass.

### fx.filter.abl.filther
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.filther filter. second input is frequency modulation. only available in max 9.

### fx.filter.abl.lowpass
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.dfm filter. second input is frequency modulation. only available in max 9.

### fx.filter.abl.vowel
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.vowel filter. second audio input is switchable between cutoff and formant modulation. only available in max 9.

### fx.filter.fixed.bank
- fixed filter bank based on the moog 914 with an option to split odd and even bands to different outputs. 

- uses airwindows style non-linear summing to recombine the bands, so clips internally if driven too hard. 

- if you want to modulate frequency the fx.filter.reson is a single band, designed for modulation, and you can use it polyphonically to approximate a moveable version of the fixed filter bank.

### fx.filter.reson
- wrapper for max msp's reson~ object, a simple digital biquad resonant bandpass filter with audio-rate modulation of one parameter of your choice. optionally frequencies can be quantised to the notes of a scale defined in core.scales.shapes

### fx.filter.vactrol.lpg
- modelled vactrol lpg, based on the paper and example patches by Julian Parker and Stefano D’Angelo. 

- http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/publications/papers/dafx13-lpg/

### fx.freeze
- freeze time! multiple ways. stereo in stereo out.

### fx.freqshift
- max msp's freqshift object. for both positive and negative shifts mix both outputs. the audio rate input is fm of the freq set by the slider

### fx.metal.box
- Gentle saturation models. Based on multi-sampled impulses from studio hardware. Best in the subtle ranges, and particularly work well for gelling sounds together with subtle intermodulation. But you can push them harder - there's plenty of headroom in the samples. If you drive them you should turn upsampling on for the block, 4x works well usually. The bite control adjusts the dynamic behaviour of the saturation, as you turn it up more of the transients are allowed through.

### fx.mod.abl.chorus
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.chorus. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.mod.abl.ensemble
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.ensemble. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.mod.abl.flanger
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.flanger. stereo in stereo out, but there's no crossfeed so you could use one side as an envelope input. only available in max 9.

### fx.mod.abl.phaser
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.phaser. stereo in stereo out, but there's no crossfeed so you could use one side as an envelope input. only available in max 9.

### fx.mod.abl.vibrato
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.vibrato. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.multi.conv.2d
- Experimental, likely to change. Like convolution, but working with a set of impulse responses taken at many different signal levels. Surprisingly pleasant way of modelling 'weakly nonlinear' hardware saturation.

- The default is to look up (and interpolate between) impulse levels based on the current sample value, but using an envelope here also sounds good. There's a second, very slow, rms env follower that you can feed in here too to add character.

- As opposed to the multi.conv.1d block, this one loads a pair of impulses and lets you fade between them manually or driven by the signal or envelopes.  

- This block supports oversampling, which is recommended if you're getting more overdriven tones out of it.

### fx.multiband.drive
- Multiband drive, with isolator outputs.  Based on multilayer transfer curves sampled from hardware processors.  Made by Luke Abbott.

### fx.pitch.divider
- an octave divider / sub oscillator generator inspired by the 4ms atoner

### fx.pitch.gate
- pitch detecting gate, based on an idea Waclaw Zimpel had. the idea is to separate different pitches to different outputs. only works with monophonic input audio, results may vary depending on the source. Waclaw was using the m4l version of this with a mic inside the barrel of his clarinet, which gives a very clean signal that works well.

- in single voice mode output 1 is the 'selected notes' and output 2 is the 'unselected notes'. 

- if multiple voices are instantiated then each voice only selects / unselects one note from the list of available ones.

- as with the fx.pitch.retune block you set the notes you want either using a scale (defined in the core.scales.shapes block) or midi input.

- the midi outputs give you (on 1) the detected pitch and (on 2) the gate status of the voice, which you could use to drive an envelope, for example.

### fx.pitch.retune
- automatic retuner, autotune-like, tries to force incoming (monophonic) audio to fit the scale (or list of allowed notes) it's been given. you can set scales using the core.scales.shapes block or with midi in. 

- also outputs detected pitch (though a limitation of the max object it uses means this is just note, not octave).

### fx.pitch.shift
- pitch shift

### fx.pultec.bass.eq
- Simple bass EQ. You can choose a frequency position and a whether to only boost or also attenuate (the two don't quite line up, and the result is often useful). 

- This block is built from a set of modified multi-level impulses taken through a cheap 500-rack pultec clone I have in my studio, along with the 'bite' control from fx.metal.box. This piece of hardware ended up needing quite long impulses so it uses more cpu than the other multi-impulse models in benny.

### fx.reverb.abl.darkhall
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.darkhall reverb. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.reverb.abl.plate
- wrapper for the abl.device.reverb. mono in stereo out simple plate reverb. only available in max 9.

### fx.reverb.abl.prism
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.prism reverb. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.reverb.abl.quartz
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.quartz reverb. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.reverb.abl.shimmer
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.quartz reverb. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.reverb.abl.tides
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.tides reverb. stereo in stereo out. only available in max 9.

### fx.thermal.eq
- Simple EQ. Great at the end of an instrument or part. You can choose a highpass position and a single area of the spectrum to emphasise. The emphasis pushes into the drive in a lovely way.

- This block is built from a set of modified multi-level impulses taken through a british-made tube preamp/eq I have in my studio, along with the 'bite' control from fx.metal.box.

- If you're running low on cpu the impulse length control set to 32 uses half as much, but in some cases doesn't quite make the same spectral changes.

### fx.varispeed.looper
- Flexible buffer record/playback device inspired by monome norns' softcut: record and play into and out of the buffer can occur at any rate you like. Multiple voices can access the same or different wave buffers. All jumps and loops are crossfaded smoothly. The buffer it uses is tagged with timestamps and metadata and available (as one of the waves on the waves page) for other blocks to play or write into. You can save this wave from there if you fill the buffer with something you like. Does an excellent impression of how BBD delays repitch, but is capable of far more - loopers, buffer-fx, repitchers, complex delays, sample-mangling, live resampling, etc

### fx.warps
- A wrapper for Volker Böhm's port of Émilie Gillet's Warps module, which lets you smoothly fade between several different algorithms for combining two signals. 

- In 'easter' mode it acts as a frequency shifter, with algo controlling freq,timbre xfading upper/lower sidebands,level 1 controlling feedback and level 2 xfading dry and wet.

### fx.wavefold
- wavefolder modelled roughly after the doepfer one

### fx.wizard.saturation
- W I Z A R D S A T U R A T I O N##By Luke Abbott

## utility

### utility.abl.3band.eq
- wrapper for the abl.device.channeleq. stereo. only available in max 9.

### utility.abl.compressor
- wrapper for the abl.device.compressor. only available in max 9. the second output is the compressor gain reduction amount.

### utility.abl.env.follow
- wrapper for the abl.device.envfollower. a simple envelope follower. only available in max 9.

### utility.abl.limiter
- wrapper for the abl.device.limiter. stereo. only available in max 9.

### utility.abl.transient.design
- wrapper for the abl.dsp.transientdesigner. a simple transient design effect with a separate input for the control signal. only available in max 9.

### utility.audio.smooth
- Uses a 2 pole low pass filter modulated by a bandpass out of the same filter to smooth values in a way which responds well to fast changes. Algorithm by Andrew Simper of Cytomic from here: https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/DynamicSmoothing.pdf. The 'sensitivity' control governs how much the bandpass modulates the lowpass.

### utility.band.splitter
- crossover, splits a signal into two frequency bands.

### utility.basic.file.player
- lets you open a file and play it. autostarts on record. handy for rendering a stem through a benny fx chain, for example.

- for playing waves with more control try wave scan (lets you skip eg stem recordings maintaining phase with the loop in the recording) or the sample player or sample tracker blocks.

- you can drag and drop waves onto the benny logo on the launcher and they'll be loaded into the waves page for you.

### utility.bonk
- wrapper for Volker Böhm's 64bit port of Miller Puckette's bonk~ object for max/msp. detects drum hits and outputs midi. to train it so it can identify which drum is which it needs to hear at least 10 of each with learn mode on, then turn learn off.

- *at the moment learn mode works but the save/recall of learned drum templates isn't implemented.

### utility.comparator
- Comparator - tells you if one input is bigger than the other. Can also send out midi events when this changes, in one direction or other. The 'distance' output is high when the inputs are close and low when they're not, and makes a rounder sound when processing audio waveforms.

### utility.cv.scale.quantise
- Quantises notes to the scales defined in the core.scales.shapes module. 

- This version is optimised around supporting CV input for audio-rate quantising of control signals. There is a midi-only scale quantise block that uses slightly less resources.

### utility.delay
- uncoloured digital delay. time settings in samples, vectors, ms and beats are ADDED together. each cable connection step in the patch introduces 1x vector's worth of delay.

### utility.env.asr
- ASR envelope, follower, slew etc

### utility.env.eight.stage
- 8 stage multi-mode envelope. easily chainable, lots of interesting trigger ins and outs.

### utility.env.four.stage
- 4 stage multi-mode envelope. easily chainable, lots of interesting trigger ins and outs.

### utility.eq.peak
- a single band of nonstandard stereo peak/notch eq. partially gain compensated, airwindows style nonlinear internal summing, selfmod. cut is a subtle (undistorted) notch, boost fades from a peak kind of shape into more of a bandpass at the extreme settings. 

- all parameters are smoothed, this block was designed with flocking in mind - eg for eq peaks that move out of each other's way.

- pan goes wider than the stereo field - ie if abs(pan)>1 the opposite effect starts to happen on the other side - a peak on the left gets a cut on the right, etc.

### utility.gate
- very basic gate

### utility.lowpass.highpass
- airwindows capacitor2 - a lowpass / highpass with modelled self-modulation.

### utility.mid.side
- mid-side processor

### utility.pan.mono
- takes a mono input, lets you adjust pan. has audio-rate control input.

### utility.record.endpoint.stereo
- DOES NOTHING. but is a convenient way to record a stereo wav - just route whatever into it and arm it to record. useful for recording multiple blocks. passes through unaltered audio.

### utility.sacred.channel
- A synth voice minus the oscillators - a morphing filter and a saturdating vca driven by an ADSR envelope generator.  VCA floor can be raised with 'Open VCA' parameter to be used as a saturation effect.  Output filter is 12db shape morphing filter similar to a SEM.  Made by Luke Abbott.

### utility.self.tuner
- self-tuning midi to cv converter. 

- connect your osc's output to the listen input. connect the cv output to the osc cv input. optionally if you want to modulate the osc's frequency do it THROUGH this block, via the second input. play notes into the midi input here. 

- if you have more than one oscillator you can add more voices to the tuner for polyphonic midi. the midi through out is useful for lining envelopes up with voices.

- IMPORTANT make sure you've used the hardware config tool to run at least one loopback test so it can store the measured loopback latency for your current system. this helps tuner stability.

### utility.sidechain.compressor
- simple sidechain compressor

### utility.spectrum
- pops open a window with a spectrum view. todo: draw it in benny instead.

### utility.transient.splitter
- detects transients, and outputs them from the first output, and absolutely everything thats left comes out of the other output. if you mix them back together you get your original sound back, but the suggested use is to process one part of the sound separately from the other.

### utility.vca.env.adsr
- ADSR envelope generator and saturating vca.  VCA floor can be raised with 'Open VCA' parameter to be used as a saturation effect.  Made by Luke Abbott.

### utility.vca.env.asr
- VCA with integrated ASR envelope, follower, slew etc

### utility.vca
- log/lin vca

### utility.xfade
- each voice of this is just a vca controlled by the main xfade slider, so it can xfade between either inputs or outputs.

- to fade one input signal between a number of outputs connect the input to every voice. 

- to xfade between a number of inputs connect every output to a single destination.

## mixer

### mixer.bus
- provides a UI for all connected mixer channel blocks. optionally you can put the mixer bus ui in the bottom panel area. 

- every mixer.mono/mixer.stereo etc block has to be routed, at unity gain, to one of these, to make the airwindows non-linear summing magic work.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without it the mixer defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.mono.basic
- mono mixer channel. 

- the *voicing* slider sets the character of each channel - it controls eq shape and stereo width together.

- 'clean' is just sub-sonic / ultrasonic filters, the kick and sub curves are designed to work together, and the other voicings progressively get brighter and wider as you go up. the amount slider and sweep slider adjust the depth and frequencies of whichever voicing you've picked.

- this concept is borrowed from a module by worrng modules.

- the mono version of this block has a very simple sidechain compressor.

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.mono.comp
- mono mixer channel. 

- based around luke abbott's 'abb.boff' multiband channel compressor with tilt control. 

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.mono.tape
- mono mixer channel. 

- runs a wide peak eq with adaptive q into airwindows' totape6 and then partially cancels out that eq afterwards, leaving a squashy but dynamic signal with performable control over emphasis. with amount positive this emphasis is tapey, with amount negative the rest of the sound is tapey but the emphasis is clean. there is a high pass filter at the end of the channel.

- the mono version of this block has a very simple sidechain compressor.

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT this block needs airwindows totape6 to do anything at all. also the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.mono.thermal
- mono mixer channel using the multi-convolution recordings of a british tube eq that are also in the fx.thermal.eq block.

- the sidechain compression input feeds into the model in interesting ways, removing peak detail as well as the normal sidechain ducking. 

- Like the other mixer blocks this uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.stereo.basic
- stereo mixer channel. 

- use the *voicing* slider to pick an eq shape for each channel, amound and sweep then adjust it. voicings also affect the stereo width of channels. this concept is borrowed from a module by worrng modules.

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.stereo.comp
- stereo mixer channel. 

- based around a mid-side modification of luke abbott's 'abb.boff' multiband channel compressor with tilt control. 

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.stereo.tape
- stereo mixer channel. 

- runs a wide peak eq with adaptive q into airwindows' totape6 (configured for mid side) and then partially cancels out that eq afterwards, leaving a squashy but dynamic signal with performable control over emphasis. with amount positive this emphasis is tapey, with amount negative the rest of the sound is tapey but the emphasis is clean. there is a high pass filter at the end of the channel.

- uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT this block needs airwindows totape6 to do anything at all. also the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.

### mixer.stereo.thermal
- stereo mixer channel using the multi-convolution recordings of a british tube eq that are also in the fx.thermal.eq block.

- in mid side mode there are separate controls for the side channel. cutting the bass in the sides and boosting and saturating the top is a good 'vinyl simulation'

- (aside: on a record player the L R channels are the sides of the groove, at 45 degrees. up and down therefore is the center channel, side-to-side is the side channel. the latter has much less headroom before saturation than the former. this, combined with the RIAA bias curve means that the side channel high frequencies get gently saturated, giving a pleasant fizzy width.) 

- Like the other mixer blocks this uses airwindows console7 for nice summing and drive. 

- MUST BE ALL ROUTED FROM THIS BLOCK INTO A mixer.bus BLOCK.

- IMPORTANT the non-linear summing will only work if you have the airwindows console 7 vsts (console7channel64, console7cascade64, console7buss64) installed, without them it defaults to normal digital summing.
